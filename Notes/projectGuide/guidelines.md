**Project Guidelines**
***

**Milestone 1: Project Ideation** _(Due: Oct, 1)_ <br>
_Objective_: Define the core idea of the project.

1.	**Brainstorming Session**: Gather as a team and brainstorm potential project ideas. Consider factors like feasibility, interest, and potential impact.
2.	**Idea Selection**: Narrow down to one idea that the team agrees upon.
3.	**Project Description**: Write a brief description of the project, outlining its main purpose and the problem it aims to solve.

**Deliverable**: A PDF document containing the selected project idea and its description.

***


**Milestone 2: Research, Design, and Technology Stack** _(Due: Oct, 15)_ <br>
_Objective_: Understand the project's requirements, tools, and frameworks to design its structure.

1.	Information Gathering: Research similar projects or products in the market. Identify what works and potential areas of improvement.
2.	User Stories: Create user stories to understand the features from an end-user perspective. _(important)_
3.	Wireframing: Design basic wireframes for the project's user interface. Tools like Figma or Sketch can be useful. _(important)_
4.	Frontend, Backend, and Database Framework: this have already been decided for this course! 
5.	Additional Tools: Identify any additional tools or APIs needed (e.g., authentication tools, third-party APIs).

**Deliverable**: A document outlining the chosen technology stack, Wireframes, and user stories.

**Milestone 3: Database & Front-End Prototype** _(Due: Nov, 16)_ <br>
_Objective_: Create the basic UI components based on the wireframes, utilize any content generator to fill out the website.

1. Mock Data: Use static JSON files or JavaScript objects within your React components as placeholders for real data. This can simulate how your components will render actual data from a backend.
2. Third-party Tools: There are tools and libraries like MirageJS. That allow you to mock API endpoints and simulate a backend server, making it easier to replicate real-world scenarios without a database.

**Deliverable**: A document outlining the database design and a working prototype of the project.
